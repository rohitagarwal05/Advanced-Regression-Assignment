# Surprise Housing Advanced Regression Assignment
> This project was built as part of Advanced Regression module assignment during the course of AI/ML by IIIT-B and Upgrad.


## Contents of Repository
1. Dataset - train.csv actual dataset used for the assignment.
2. Python Notebook - Which contains the Surprise Housing Advanced Regression assignment.
3. PDF File - Which contains the assignment based subjective questions answered.


## General Information
- This project was built as part of Advanced Regression module assignment during the course of AI/ML by IIIT-B and Upgrad.
- What is the background of your project? - It is based out on a case study for understanding advanced regression concepts and implement it practically.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? - A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- What is the dataset that is being used? - train.csv which contains data set from the sale of houses in Australia.



## Conclusions
1. GrLivArea - an increase of 1 square foot of house area above ground, the price will increase by 1.09 to 1.11 times
2. OverallQual_9 & OverallQual_8: if the overall material and finish of the house is Very Good or Excellent, the price of house will increase by 1.08 to 1.13 times.
3. Functional_Typ: if the home functionality is typical, then the price of house will increase by 1.07 to 1.08 times.
4. Neighborhood_Crawfor: if Crawford is a nearby location, then the price of house will increase by 1.07 to 1.09 times.
5. Exterior1st_BrkFace: if the exterior covering on the house is Brick Face, the price of house will increase by 1.07 to 1.08 times.
6. Central Air Conditioned - If present in house , then house price can increase by 1.05-1.06 times.
